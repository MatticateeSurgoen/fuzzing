Security Reasearch is about Failing.
Public Reasearch For fuzzing assumes couple of 
things that is 
  1) You are working on Linux
  2) You are working on System where AFL works
  3) You have fork
  4) You have source to the code base
  5) You have capable build system that is for building it.
  6) You have capable build system that is for building it
    and you have easy to replace compilers.

If you have above things than you can build a 
instrumentation binary else you are force to
use QEMU or AFL QEMU. it is worst experience 
just AFL.
